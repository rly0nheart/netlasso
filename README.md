**Net Lasso** utilises the [Netlas.io API](https://netlas.io/api) to perform advanced searches for internet-connected (IoT) devices based on user-provided search queries.

# Installation
Net Lasso can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/netlasso) by running the following command
```commandline
pip install netlasso
```

# Authentication
> A valid Netlas.io API key will be required to use Net Lasso. The API key can be obtained by creating a free account on [Netlas.io](https://netlas.io)

Assumming you already have an API key, you can proceed to authenticate Net Lasso with the key by running
```commandline
netlasso --authenticate <api_key>
```
> The API key will be written to a *.netlas-auth* file in the program's installation directory.
>> This ensures that the key won't be easily accessible to anyone.

# Usage
After authenticating, you can start searching by calling Net Lasso with the required command-line arguments
```commandline
netlasso --query <query_string>
```

# Netlas.io Dorks
