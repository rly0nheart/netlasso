**Net Lasso** utilises the [Netlas.io API](https://netlas.io/api) to perform advanced searches for internet-connected (
IoT) devices based on user-provided search queries.

# Installation

Net Lasso can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/netlasso) by running the following command

```commandline
pip install netlasso
```

# Usage

You can start searching by calling **Net Lasso** with a search query

```commandline
netlasso <query_string>
```
> Call `netlasso` without command-line arguments to run it in interactive CLI mode.
>> Calling `netlasso` with only the `-d/--debug` flag will run the interactive CLI in debug mode.
